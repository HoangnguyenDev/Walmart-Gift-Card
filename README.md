Walmart offers two types of gift cards - traditional Walmart gift cards and Walmart Visa gift cards. While both can be used in-store and online, there are some key differences between them. Let's take a closer look at Walmart Visa gift cards.

### What is a Walmart Visa Gift Card?

A Walmart Visa gift card is a prepaid card that can be used anywhere Visa debit cards are accepted. This means that it can be used not only at Walmart but also at other retailers, restaurants, and online merchants. These gift cards are available in various denominations, ranging from $10 to $500, making them suitable for any budget.

### How Do Walmart Visa Gift Cards Work?

When purchasing a [walmart visa gift card balance](https://wmgift.net/), you can either buy a physical card from a Walmart store or purchase an eGift card online. Once you activate the card, it can be used immediately for purchases. The balance on the card will decrease with each transaction until it reaches zero. If the balance is not enough for a particular purchase, you can use another payment method to complete the transaction.

### Advantages of Walmart Visa Gift Cards

1.  Flexibility:

One of the biggest advantages of Walmart Visa gift cards is their flexibility. These gift cards can be used at any merchant that accepts Visa debit cards, giving the receiver a wide range of options to choose from.

2.  Easy to purchase:

Walmart Visa gift cards are readily available at any Walmart store, making them a convenient option for last-minute gifts. They can also be purchased online and sent as an eGift card.

3.  No fees:

Unlike some other prepaid cards, Walmart Visa gift cards do not have any activation or inactivity fees. This means that the full value of the card can be used for purchases.

4.  Security:

These gift cards are safer than carrying cash, as they can be easily replaced if lost or stolen. Additionally, they can only be used until the balance is depleted, eliminating the possibility of overspending.
